# text_summarization_with_NLP
Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document.  Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

“Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning”

There are broadly two different approaches that are used for text summarization:

    Extractive Summarization
    
    Abstractive Summarization


Extractive Summarization

The name gives away what this approach does. We identify the important sentences or phrases from the original text and extract only those from the text. Those extracted sentences would be our summary. 

Abstractive Summarization

This is a very interesting approach. Here, we generate new sentences from the original text. This is in contrast to the extractive approach we saw earlier where we used only the sentences that were present. The sentences generated through abstractive summarization might not be present in the original text.
